I craft precision models, blending efficiency with optimized FLOPS.

I am a seasoned engineer at Intel Corporation with 6 years of invaluable experience. During my early tenure at Intel, I successfully crafted an end-to-end scalable production data pipeline on AWS. My primary focus was on ensuring data integrity, consistency, and transformation, resulting in a system catering to 10+ downstream internal and external customers, receiving over 30 million hits monthly.

🌐 Open Source Contributions:
As an open-source enthusiast, I contribute to the Linux Foundation project, Secure Federated AI OpenFL. Notably, I implemented an efficient federation component timeout feature, enhancing the project's functionality. Additionally, I introduced JAX (FLAX) Cifar10 and linear regression-based federated learning examples, showcasing my commitment to advancing federated learning frameworks.
